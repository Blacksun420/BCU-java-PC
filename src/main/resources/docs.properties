sec0sub0=Introduction
sec0sub0text=BCU, short for Battle Cats Unlimited, is an Open-Source unofficial simulator for PONOS' mobile game The Battle Cats.\nAside from showcasing data from the game and allowing you to play any stage with any unit,it allows players to make their own stages, units, enemies,\nand share them with anyone,packed with tools to make even your wildest concepts a reality.
sec0sub1=BlackSun Personal Fork
sec0sub1text=Referred as such due to originating from a GitHub fork separate from the main simulator, this is a private unofficial edition of BCU made by\nKuuroiTaiyou (Blacksun) and DreamyTsuki for personal enjoyment rather than as some public project.\n\nIt features several Quality-Of-Life changes and mostly niche features that can be expected from a private project,although it removes some other features as well.\nDue to these new features, PACKS MADE WITH THIS PERSONAL VERSION ARE INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE OFFICIAL BCU.
sec0sub2=Q&A
sec0sub2text=Q:What can I customize in BCU?\nA:Almost every aspect of a battle\n\nQ:What are .userpack files?\nA:Userpack files are files containing all data from a custom pack in one file ready to be shared with others, that is also encrypted to protect the data.\nOther pack formats are .bcupack in .pack.bcuzip, the former belonging to really old BCU versions, the latter to packs made with the official BCU\n\nQ:Can I port content from BCU to the real game?\nA:No. Both structure data in their own way.
